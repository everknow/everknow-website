Our research into interoperability leverages and combines cutting edge features produced in the context of a pool of prominent solutions such as [IBC](https://ibc.cosmos.network/), [ILP](https://interledger.org) and [Substrate](https://substrate.io)

The primary objective is to support a range of distributed application by fine tuning performance, decentralisation, transparency and trust in accordance to the requirements and finding the ideal compromise for each specific use case

Bespoke protocol extension in this sense can offer a very good element of innovation in a variety of industry verticals

## Distribution

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the infrastructure and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner across a network that's spread across multiple entities or locations. Its decentralized digital storage capability eliminates the need for a central authority to keep a check against manipulation and is governed by the rules of the network. 

Network topologies are instrumental to enable this computation paradigm. At EverKnow we acknowledge the importance to pair the technology with an associated cultural change to ensure the development design and approach gets upgraded, where appropriate, from client-server to a distributed peer-to-peer architecture.

The advantages can be measured in:

- increased resilience, as single point of failures are removed
- increased security, as malicious attacks perpetrated against multiple nodes are typically deterred by higher costs
- reduced congestion, as we can balance traffic among multiple nodes
- possibility to operate a trustless economy, that is without the need of a central authority trusted by all participants 

The adoption of distributed networks comes with challenges.

One of the primary challenge is to ensure **consensus** among the participants' interactions. DLT can then use a redundant multi-node storage reinforcement to pervent the manipulation of historical records. However driving this initial agreement on what are the honest records and their time-order involves procedures that are under active research.

In recent years the the way to achieve consensus has eveolved from Bitcoin's Proof of Work (POW) towards more evolved forms of Proof of Stake (POS). POS techniques typically come with a lower carbon footprint.

The ongoing research keeps producing more sophisticated and feature-rich Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus approaches.
One of the technology that is getting traction nowadays is [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com)

At EverKnow we pride ourselves of having experimented on advanced and innovative forms of consensus for several years. This along with adequate forms of network topologies is one of the core technological advancements we are chasing.

## Governance

Governance can be considered similar to consensus, as its purpose is also to come to an agreement among multiple participants. The distinction is primarily linked to the degree of people's participation. To achieve this a set of tools to support the decision making process is needed. Further to that, a series of incentives and deterrents can be put in place to encourage the fair and honest behaviour of the participants.

This is still an aspect that is going through an intesnse evolution. The state of the art typically involves the distribution of voting rights among a group of community stakeholders. The transparency of the operations can be monitored by a wider audience, while the voting strength can be derived via a linear or quadratic function of a committed stake.

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) make large use of these approaches and are fast becoming the standard for projects creating self-sustainable applications and services in the blockchain industry. DAOs unlock new opportunities to manage configuration changes, allocate budget from a treasury, collaboratively monitor distributed services and/or grant special permissions to users.

In some scenarios the pool of decision makers can also be extended to the wider community. DAOs have already been applied to several use cases including social technology, media, investment, venture, art.

EverKnow is actively researching into novel forms of governance that can be fairer and effective. Democracy in our society clearly represents an inspirational cultural guide in this sense, and we believe it can be augmented with an adequate technology support.

## Automation

Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.

The industry has embraced for a number of years the approach introduced by the Ethereum network and supported by its Virtual Machine (EVM). One of the attractive aspects of smart contracts is that their source code, which contains the rules by which interactions are handled, is normally available for inspection and, once stored on chain, it is guaranteed to be immutable and therefore its outcome can be predicted.

Smart contracts in the Ethereum network however require the presence of a virtual machine to execute. This often limits, in terms of performance, expressiveness and economic suistainability the automations that can be designed on top of it.

This is another area where EverKnow are committed to research for innovation. This can range from the utilization of a broader variety of programming languages, to the production of enhanced virtual machines.
