## Interoperability 

Our research into interoperability leverages and combines cutting edge features produced in the context of a pool of prominent solutions such as [IBC](https://ibc.cosmos.network/), [ILP](https://interledger.org) and [Substrate](https://substrate.io)

The primary objective is to support a range of distributed application by fine tuning performance, decentralisation, transparency and trust in accordance to the requirements and finding the ideal compromise for each specific use case

Bespoke protocol extension in this sense can offer a very good element of innovation in a variety of industry verticals

## Distribution

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the infrastructure and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner across a network that's spread across multiple entities or locations. The decentralized digital database eliminates the need for a central authority to keep a check against manipulation and is governed by the rules of the network.

## Governance

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are fast becoming the standard for projects creating self-sustainable applications and services around the blockchain industry. DAO unlocks new opportunities by enabling users to contribute and vote on changes.

DAO’s can for example, be used to hold members funds and allocate based on community decisions. There are many uses already including social, media, investment, venture, art.

## Automation

Smart contracts are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.
