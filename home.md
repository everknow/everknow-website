## Partnerships

[![mocda](root/img/mocda.webp)](https://mocda.org)

Together with our **[mocda.org](https://mocda.org)** partners we collaborate with creative minds. We are interested in exploring unconventional thinking as a driver for digital innovation.

If you are interested, or have the impression that your creativity could benefit from technological enhancements be most welcome to join us in our journey.

We strongly believe that the desire to embrace new forms of creativity and auto-determine the rules by which digital artifacts are governed and protected, are the true motivation behind a movement that has led to the surge of the present forms of decentralised technology.

We have the ambition to explore new uncharted models of social interaction that go beyond the state of the art.

There is a new world of possibility to discover as we expand our horizon together.

Please be welcome to visit some example of our creative thinking on **algorithms** in collaboration with the **[Venice Biannale 2019](Venice-Biennale-on-ALGORITHM.md)** published on the **[Thinking Head](http://www.thinking-head.net)**.
