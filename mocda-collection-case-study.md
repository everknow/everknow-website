# MoCDA's Collection Case Study

## Executive Summary

Improve the art market by providing:

- An accessible set of tools to lower the entry barrier for artists, collectors and the audience in general.
- Assistance for new joiners and customers during their journey into the digital space.
- A transparent registry where the actions taken by automations and humans can be verified by anyone.
- A legal framework to enable control on the authenticity and copyright.
- A cultural contextualisation to expose a valuation vector that is independent from the value at which an artwork is traded.
- The possibility to verify the artwork inclusion in the MoCDA collection, which will give prestige to a selected group of works and the artists.
- Partnership with a group of estabilished organisations to operate a reinforcement of the record's validity by consensus.

## Services

The **Tier1** services will include:

- The registration of an artwork via an unique identifier.
- The storage of the digital artwork on redundant and permanent peer to peer or cloud solutions.
- A visualisation of the artworks in possession of a collector.
- The production of limited editions as a one-off release. If this is actioned by the collector, relevant copyrights might be handled by MoCDA on behalf of the collector via a consultancy payment fee, without which MoCDA takes no responsibility. 
- An addressable wallet that enables the visualization of assets in one's possession.
- Tools to automatically verify the provenance, ownership and record of trade related transactions.

### Note1: 
The **Tier1** services can be extended for a wide range of collectors to use. This includes artists themselves.

### Note2:
Personal data will not be present on the shared ledger. This is in order to preserve the identity of the private collectors. Public collectors metadata such as the ones from MoCDA itself will of course be public.

### Conclusion: 
The main expectation with the tier1 services is that they function automatically. Any human support listed in tier2 is possible but charged extra in order to make it economically sustainable.

The **Tier2** services will include:

- The possibility to recover lost credentials for unlocking an addressable wallet.
- An entry level assistance to get to know the tools.
- A legal support for handling the copyrights.
- An independent art valuation.
- A verifiable inclusion in the MoCDA collection.
- An assistance in the resolution of disputes related to possible infringements.

## Supporting market stories 
As part of our collaboration with digital art marketplaces KnowOrigin and SuperRare we have supported a number of atists with curatorial advisory, articles and exhibitions. As a result, the majority of the artists we engaged with have experienced a significant market appreciation and have gained a international recognition in the digital and contemporary art scene.
