## Consultancy

If you need help assisting and delivering EverKnow expert consultants and contractors can be hired anywhere in the world. EverKnow offer support from individual consultants on a project to complete teams taking full ownership of the deliverable. Often a project starts with a business analyst / solution architect who will engage further full time consultants on the team as the project develops. As the project development progresses and internal confidence increases, their presence may reduce but they will always be available to answer questions

EverKnow pride ourselves on being able to work with you across time zones so no matter what your physical global location the same exceptional standards of project delivery will be provided by us. We support the successful delivery of your project through well established and dedicated Project Management and communications processes that facilitate the efficient technical consultancy for which we are known

## Anti slavery / Anti bribery content
We strive to be a great place to work for EverKnow people. We want our employees to be fully engaged with our Company and motivated to give their all and we want their contribution to be recognised and rewarded.
We will therefore not tolerate forced, bonded or compulsory labour, human trafficking and other kinds of slavery within our own operations or within our supply chain and are committed to taking appropriate steps to ensure that everyone who works for EverKnow – in any capacity – benefits from a working environment in which their fundamental rights and freedoms are respected.
We adopt procedures that contribute to ensuring modern slavery does not occur in our business or supply chains and we expect organisations with whom we do business to adopt and enforce policies to comply with the legislation.

## Sustainability pledges: diversity / Carbon footprint etc

We believe we can be a successful business and do good to protect our people and the planet for future generations to come.
We are motivated to drive change within our own organisation whilst working with our partners, our supply chain, and supporting our customers on their socially responsible journey through the technology we provide
